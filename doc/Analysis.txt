Run Time Analysis: worst-case big-O notation (counting code line as efficiency measure)
Task 0:
Input: texts, calls
Output: none
Time complexity: O(2) ~ O(1)

Task 1:
Input: texts, calls
Output: number of distinct telephone numbers
Time complexity: O(12n + 5) ~ O(n)

Task 2:
Input: calls
Output: busiest telephone number
Time complexity: O(nlog(n) + 7n + 6) ~ O(nlog(n))

Task3:
Part A:
Input: calls
Output: Area codes and prefixes of required number
Time complexity: O(6n + 3) ~ O(n)
Part B:
Input calls
Output: Required percent
Time complexity: O(6n + 4) ~ O(n)

Task4:
Input: texts, calls
Output: Telemarketers
Time complexity: O(4n + 5) ~ O(n)
